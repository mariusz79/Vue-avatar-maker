# Avatar-Maker

The goal of the app is to let a user enter name or surname, or both, and then press a button that generates the avatar. More customization options are also available.

The app is using a cool little service, UI Avatars, that lets you generate avatars with initials from names on the fly without any kind of backend process and has a simple-to-use API.

To make it a little more complicated, I would add user authorisation in case if user wants to keep a history of all the avatars he has generated.
